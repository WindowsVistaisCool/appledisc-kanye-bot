    "Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass\nNeck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass\nYour pussy's too good, I need to crash\nYour titties, let 'em out, free at last\nThank God almighty, they free at last",
    "For all my Southside n****s that know me best\nI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\nWhy? I made that bitch famous\nI made that bitch famous",
    "I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue\nI don't joke with no one, they'll say he died so young\nI done had a bad case of too many bad days\nGot too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays",
    "You got sick thoughts? I got more of 'em\nYou got a sister-in-law you'd smash? I got four of 'em\nDamn, those is your sisters\nYou did somethin' unholy to them pictures\nDamn, you need to be locked up\nNah, we need a bigger hot tub"
